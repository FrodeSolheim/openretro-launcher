# Privacy notice

TL;DR; The Launcher application respects your privacy, and doesn't do anything
bad. But please read on for some details if you are interested.

## Latest version check

The Launcher application checks for updates by default. When this happens,
a request is sent to fs-uae.net to get the latest version. This means that
your IP address is temporarily logged by the web server handling the request,
and that the name of your operating system is sent to the server. This
information is only stored temporary as part of the webserver logs, and is
not used to identify you.

If you want to opt out of this, you can disable the version check in
Prefs -> Privacy.

## Some files are downloaded on demand

WHDLoad support files, etc. Write something about that + add option to opt
out?

## Online game database

Write something about this as well.. -and write and refer to privacy policy
of openretro.org.
